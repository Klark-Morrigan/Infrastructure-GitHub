.SYNOPSIS
    GitHub API utilities for infrastructure repos.

.DESCRIPTION
    Provides GitHub-specific functions extracted from Infrastructure.Common
    to keep each module cohesive and single-purpose.

    Current functions: (none - populated in Step 2)

    Each function lives in its own file under Public\ and is dot-sourced
    below so diffs stay focused on a single function per commit.

# Export-ModuleMember controls what is actually callable after Import-Module.
# It takes precedence over FunctionsToExport in the psd1 at runtime, so both
# must be kept in sync. FunctionsToExport serves a separate purpose: it is
# read by Get-Module -ListAvailable, Find-Module, and PSGallery for fast
# discovery without loading the module. The shared Module.Tests.ps1 in the
# run-unit-tests action enforces that every Public\*.ps1 file appears in both.
